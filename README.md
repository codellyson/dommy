You're looking to build a Chrome extension that:

Activates on demand (e.g. via a popup toggle or icon click).

Allows hovering over DOM elements on any page, highlighting them visually.

Lets you screenshot the highlighted DOM element.

# Feature Breakdown

1. Toggle Extension
   A popup with a switch/button to enable or disable hover mode.

2. Highlight on Hover
   When enabled, mouseover any element on the page gives it a border (e.g., red outline).

Store the currently hovered element in memory for screenshotting.

3. Screenshot the Element
   Use html2canvas or Chromeâ€™s captureVisibleTab for screenshots.

Limit capture to the bounding box of the hovered DOM element.
